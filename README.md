# toolz
[![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url]

development tools for node, devtoolz. A complete rewrite of mout.js for educational purposes.

## Why?
Why would I do something stupid like that? TO LEARN, PERIOD. While I am retyping everything in, I get
intimate with the code. I am able to play with each function and learn it inside out.

## Goals

- eduction first and foremost
- understanding the complexities of a large project
- automated build system for filesets and documentation
- formal testing with unit-tests (!console.log)
- goto library for my handlebars helpers
- practice typing in personal code style

## Installation
```bash
$ npm install akileez\toolz
```

## Usage
```js

```

## API
```js

```
